# TI IWRL6432 mmWave Radar data streaming and capture in Python


![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/statusâ€“work%20in%20progress-yellow)

> **Warning:** This repository is work in progress. **As of now none of the goals have been implemented.**

## Overview 
This project is a work-in-progress fork of the [TI IWRL6432 mmWave Radar Minimum Rangeproc DPU Implementation](https://github.com/95lux/ti_iwrl6432boost_dsp) repository which was created as part of a university assignment. 
Goal of this repo is to:
- **Implement SPI data streaming of IWRL6432 ADC and Radar Cube (Range-FFT) data** 
    - streamed data (format and which data) can then easily be adapted to your needs
    - more minimalistic approach than running the full mmwave demo project on the MCU
- **Implement an easy-to-use Python wrapper for receiving the data**
    - capture data
    - build your own experimental real-time DSP chain on top of it

Please note, that there already is an easy way to stream raw ADC data via SPI using the demo project. Please refer to TI's tutorial [here](https://e2e.ti.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/1023/Steps-for-Raw-ADC-Data-Streaming-in-IWRL6432.pdf).

#### **Brief overview of important source files:**


| `/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/`                  |  |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| [`main.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/main.c)             | Initializes hardware, configures the radar sensor, sets up DPUs, and starts FreeRTOS. |
| [`factory_cal.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/factory_cal.c)      | Restores and applies factory calibration data from flash memory. |
| [`mem_pool.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/mem_pool.c)        | Implements memory pool management functions and data structures. |
| [`mmwave_basic.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/mmwave_basic.c)    | Handles mmWave sensor initialization, configuration, and control. |
| [`mmwave_control_config.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/mmwave_control_config.c) | Configures chirp and profile settings for TI mmWave radar. |
| [`rangeproc_dpc.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/rangeproc_dpc.c)   | Implements the Range Processing DPU (FFT, object detection, SPI transmission). |
| [`spi_transmit.c`](/minimal_rangeproc_impl/src/spi_transmit.c)   | Manages SPI transmission of radar cube and ADC data, synchronized via semaphores. |


| `/minimal_rangeproc_impl/include/`           |  |
|--------------|-------------|
| [`system.h`](./minimal_rangeproc_impl/include/system.h)  | Holds most global handles and configs. |
| [`defines.h`](./minimal_rangeproc_impl/include/defines.h)  | Defines chirp parameters (antenna settings, chirp configurations, timing). Configurations can be generated using the [mmWave Sensing Estimator](https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/mmwave/mmWaveSensingEstimator/ver/2.4.0/) and the [chirp_config_to_defines.py](/scripts/chirp_config_to_defines.py) script. |



## Prerequisites
### PyFtdi
In order to use the employed PyFTDI library, a few prerequisites must be fullfilled before installing it and being able to use it. 

#### Linux
Please follow the instructions [here](https://eblot.github.io/pyftdi/installation.html#debian-ubuntu-linux). As of now this includes the following steps (no guarantee that they are still up-to-date):
- Install libusb
  ```
  sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0
  ```
- Create an udev rule to allow users to allow access to the FTDI device
  ```
  # For FT232H based devices
  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403", ATTR{idProduct}=="6014", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/11-ftdi.rules
  ```
- Reload udev rules
  ```
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
  ```
- Add users which you want to access the device toi the `plugdev` group
  ```
  sudo adduser $USER plugdev
  ```
- Finally, install PyFtdi
  ```
  pip3 install pyftdi
  ```

#### Windows
As of now, only Linux and MacOS are officially supported, although there seems to be a working way with Zadig. Please refer to the [PyFtdi documentation concerning Windows](https://eblot.github.io/pyftdi/installation.html#id1).



## FTDI C232HM-DDHSL-0 (FT232H) driver installation
### Linux
- Download the driver from [FTDI's D2XX driver page](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/)
- Extract the .tgz file
  ```
  tar -xvzf  libftd2xx-linux-x86_64-1.4.33.tgz
  ```
- Follow the instructions from the `README.pdf` in the unpacked dir. As of now this involves the following steps:
  ```
  # enter unpacked dir
  cd linux-x86_64/

  # perform the following commands as root
  sudo -s

  # copy so to /usr/local/lib and create a user-accessible symlink
  cp libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib
  chmod 0755 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.FULL_VERSION_NUMBER
  ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.FULL_VERSION_NUMBER /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so

  # copy header files and update the linker so
  cp ftd2xx.h /usr/local/include
  cp WinTypes.h /usr/local/include
  ldconfig -v
  ```

### Winows
  - Download the driver from [FTDI's D2XX driver page](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/) adnd follow the instructions listed on the page
